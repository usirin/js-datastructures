# Data Structures from CS Classes in Javascript.

This repo is not for creating something new. It's a side project for me,
and also good practice to remember the things I learned in my cs data structure class.

Those all are written as Require.js modules.

to install Require.js just execute the following command:

    bower install

I didn't choose any licence for this repo, just because those are really easy to find in the internet.
If you want to use it, be my guest.

Thanks.
